I wrote the comment on the top of code for all java file. I didn't bought the Meggy Jr device, so I just use simulator.
I try to use the arg_opts to replace with the bottom. but I don't know why it's not work.
For my "mjsimPictures" folder, it's the picture step of my "PA3_TimeChangeColor".
I have a partner, but we decided the first project works individually, so I do this project by myself.
